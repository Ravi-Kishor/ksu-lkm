* About

This repository was created to build kernelsu.ko and kernelsu_next.ko to be utilized with the Android 16 ROMs for the Motorola G54 5G as [[https://github.com/cyberknight777/dragonheart_kernel_motorola_cancunf][DragonHeart]] is no longer GKI-compliant.

As such, upstream's kernelsu/kernelsu_next.ko will not work to root via the LKM method.
